IT Help Desk Support & technician in a local college.

This past few months, my focus is on front-end web development, particularly React library.

  In addition, Iam enrolled in a Frond-End dev course offered by Coursera:

  <b><hr>A bit about me...</hr></b>
  
My coding journey began when I took a Python-For-Everybody course offered by Coursera.
  
The course was very challenging for me as I never actually written code before.
The course also introduced frond end languages such as CSS, HTML & a bit of JS.
By the end of this course, I knew I want to continue this journey by finishing Django course, which is a python based web framework.
  
Finishing Django, I decided to take the front end path, mastering JS, CSS, & HTML.
  
Currently, I am working on my own small projects to master React & JS.
